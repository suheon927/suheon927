# Hello, I'm YISUHEON! 👋

You might be wondering why my name is "YI" instead of "LEE." Honestly... I have no idea either, so please don't ask! 😂

I believe that true learning and growth happen when we push ourselves even in tough situations. That's why I always strive to work diligently and explore the world with curiosity, learning something new every day.

Let’s grow together! 🌱✨
